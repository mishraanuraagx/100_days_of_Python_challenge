## How to Use
### Day7- Hangman
    Playing this Hangman game is easy: Simply download the repository to your computer and run `hangman.py`! The game comes with its own included word list, `wordlist.txt`, which contains a list of 58,000+ English words from which the game can draw.

## Customization
### Day7- Hangman
-Want to specify your own list of words in place of the included `wordlist.txt`? Simply overwrite that file with a text file of your own of the same filename, with each word on a separate line. Compound words with spaces involved work, too (eg., ice cream).

-You can also add new words to the included `wordlist.txt` file to be used in the game. Words can be added at any place in the file but, again, add one word per line.

## Command-Line
- Some python-scripts support command-line:
    - password_generator.py
    - caesar_cipher.py

## Requirements
- The current project uses modules: random, os, tqdm.

## Who wrote this?
The program was written by Anuraag Mishra (anuraagmishra.214@gmail.com) as a leisurely project. I was learning Python to improve and decided to apply it to a project of my own to get some experience and to have some fun. This was the result!
